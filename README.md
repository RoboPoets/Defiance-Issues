# Days of Defiance Issue Reporting

This is the public issue tracker for [Days of Defiance](https://defiance.robopoets.com/en/).

## Reporting a Bug

There are two ways to report a bug. If you have a GitHub account, you can just head right
over to the [Issues](https://github.com/RoboPoets/Defiance-Issues/issues) section and open
a new one. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can send an e-mail to support@robopoets.com
with the necessary files as attachments.

### Report on GitHub

Go to the Issues section and select which kind of issue you want to create:

- **Bug reports** are for issues about game crashes or things not working correctly. In most cases,
but especially when you report a quest or story bug, it's important to attach a savegame file to the
isuue so we're able to replicate the state of the game and find the source of the bug faster.
- **Feature requests** are the right choice if you want to see something in the game thst isn't
there yet. You've been playing the game for a while and think it needs this one feature to be even
better? Create a feature request and let us know.

### Report via E-Mail

If you don't want or are unable to create a GitHub account, you can also send us an e-mail. Please
describe the bug you want to report as detailed as you can, including steps on how to reproduce it.
Attach a savegame if you can.

When dealing with bug reports and feature requests, GitHub issues take precedence over e-mail reports.
We only have limited capacity to send follow-up e-mails, so we won't be able to ask for clarification
more than once. You should be as thorough as you can in your initial e-mail.

## Savegame Locations

The location of your save files varies depending on the platform you're using. On Windows, you can usually
find them in this folder:

```
C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Defiance\Saved\SaveGames
```

On Linux systems that follow the XDG conventions, the files should be in this location:

```
/home/YOURUSERNAME/.config/Epic/Defiance/Saved
```
